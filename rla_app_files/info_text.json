If you saved the file with another name or at another location to the default, use the browse button to select thr correct file.\n\nOnce done, the path will be displayed on the right hand side plot. If you are happy, press 'Export' to export the path. By default, the output is a text file called 'polygon-path.txt' with stored at the directory: '{}'. To choose another name or location, use the bottom browse button to choose your desired location/file. The programme will create a new file if you give it a file name that does not exist yet.\n\nThis page can be viewed again by pressing the Help button in the menu bar."
